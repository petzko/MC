Here is the matrix m:
 7  6 -3  1
-2  9  6  0
 6 -6 -5  3
Here is the rowwise reverse of m:
 1 -3  6  7
 0  6  9 -2
 3 -5 -6  6
Here is the colwise reverse of m:
 6 -6 -5  3
-2  9  6  0
 7  6 -3  1
Here is the coefficient (1,0) in the rowise reverse of m:
0
Let us overwrite this coefficient with the value 4.
Now the matrix m is:
 7  6 -3  1
-2  9  6  0
 6 -6 -5  3
