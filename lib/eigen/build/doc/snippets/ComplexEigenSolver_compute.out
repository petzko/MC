Here is a random 4x4 matrix, A:
  (-0.211,0.68)  (0.108,-0.444)   (0.435,0.271) (-0.198,-0.687)
  (0.597,0.566) (0.258,-0.0452)  (0.214,-0.717)  (-0.782,-0.74)
 (-0.605,0.823)  (0.0268,-0.27) (-0.514,-0.967)  (-0.563,0.998)
  (0.536,-0.33)   (0.832,0.904)  (0.608,-0.726)  (0.678,0.0259)

The eigenvalues of A are:
 (0.137,0.505)
 (-0.758,1.22)
 (1.52,-0.402)
(-0.691,-1.63)
The matrix of eigenvectors, V, is:
  (-0.246,-0.106)     (0.418,0.263)   (0.0417,-0.296)    (-0.122,0.271)
  (-0.205,-0.629)    (0.466,-0.457)    (0.244,-0.456)      (0.247,0.23)
 (-0.432,-0.0359) (-0.0651,-0.0146)    (-0.191,0.334)   (0.859,-0.0877)
    (-0.301,0.46)    (-0.41,-0.397)     (0.623,0.328)    (-0.116,0.195)

Consider the first eigenvalue, lambda = (0.137,0.505)
If v is the corresponding eigenvector, then lambda * v = 
 (0.0197,-0.139)
    (0.29,-0.19)
(-0.0412,-0.223)
(-0.274,-0.0891)
... and A * v = 
 (0.0197,-0.139)
    (0.29,-0.19)
(-0.0412,-0.223)
(-0.274,-0.0891)

Finally, V * D * V^(-1) = 
  (-0.211,0.68)  (0.108,-0.444)   (0.435,0.271) (-0.198,-0.687)
  (0.597,0.566) (0.258,-0.0452)  (0.214,-0.717)  (-0.782,-0.74)
 (-0.605,0.823)  (0.0268,-0.27) (-0.514,-0.967)  (-0.563,0.998)
  (0.536,-0.33)   (0.832,0.904)  (0.608,-0.726)  (0.678,0.0259)
