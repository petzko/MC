Here is the matrix m:
  0.68  0.597
-0.211  0.823
 0.566 -0.605
Its singular values are:
 1.19
0.899
Its left singular vectors are the columns of the thin U matrix:
  0.388   0.866
  0.712 -0.0634
 -0.586   0.496
Its right singular vectors are the columns of the thin V matrix:
-0.183  0.983
 0.983  0.183
Now consider this rhs vector:
1
0
0
A least-squares solution of m*x = rhs is:
0.888
0.496
