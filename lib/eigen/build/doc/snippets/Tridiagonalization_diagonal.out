Here is a random self-adjoint 4x4 matrix:
    (-0.422,0)  (0.705,-1.01) (-0.17,-0.552) (0.338,-0.357)
  (0.705,1.01)      (0.515,0) (0.241,-0.446)   (0.05,-1.64)
 (-0.17,0.552)  (0.241,0.446)      (-1.03,0)  (0.0449,1.72)
 (0.338,0.357)    (0.05,1.64) (0.0449,-1.72)       (1.36,0)

The tridiagonal matrix T is:
-0.422  -1.45      0      0
 -1.45   1.01  -1.42      0
     0  -1.42    1.8   -1.2
     0      0   -1.2  -1.96

We can also extract the diagonals of T directly ...
The diagonal is:
-0.422
  1.01
   1.8
 -1.96
The subdiagonal is:
-1.45
-1.42
 -1.2
