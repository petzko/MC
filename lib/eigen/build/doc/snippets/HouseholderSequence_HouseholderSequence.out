The matrix v is:
  0.68  0.597  -0.33
-0.211  0.823  0.536
 0.566 -0.605 -0.444
The first Householder vector is: v_0 =      1 -0.211  0.566
The second Householder vector is: v_1 =      0      1 -0.605
The third Householder vector is: v_2 = 0 0 1
The Householder coefficients are: h =   0.108 -0.0452   0.258
The first Householder reflection is represented by H_0 = 
  0.892  0.0228 -0.0611
 0.0228   0.995  0.0129
-0.0611  0.0129   0.965
The second Householder reflection is represented by H_1 = 
      1       0       0
      0    1.05 -0.0273
      0 -0.0273    1.02
The third Householder reflection is represented by H_2 = 
    1     0     0
    0     1     0
    0     0 0.742
Their product is H_0 H_1 H_2 = 
  0.892  0.0255 -0.0466
 0.0228    1.04 -0.0105
-0.0611 -0.0129   0.728
If we construct a HouseholderSequence from v and h
and convert it to a matrix, we get:
  0.892  0.0255 -0.0466
 0.0228    1.04 -0.0105
-0.0611 -0.0129   0.728
